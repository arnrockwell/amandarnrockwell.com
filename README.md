# amandarnrockwell.com
Greetings, and welcome to this repository.

In here is my sourse code for my personal website, amandarnrockwell.com. This serves mainly as a record of my progress in developing my website as I learn more about coding and programming.

Like all modern websites, it's be built using modern HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Other technologies may also become involved over time. If by chance you happen to notice an error in the code, feel free to submit an issue report.

Cheers! <3
